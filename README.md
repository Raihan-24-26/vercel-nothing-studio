# React + Vite Starter

Kick off your React project with Vite using this lightweight template. It includes hot module replacement (HMR) for a rapid development workflow and basic ESLint rules for code quality.

Choose between two official plugins for optimized Fast Refresh support:

@vitejs/plugin-react: Uses Babel, offering seamless Fast Refresh for real-time updates.
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc: Leverages SWC, a fast JavaScript and TypeScript compiler, for even quicker build times and efficient Fast Refresh.
